<p><code>filemd5</code> is a variant of <a href="../../terraform/language/functions/md5.html"><code>md5</code></a>
that hashes the contents of a given file rather than a literal string.</p>

<p>This is similar to <code>md5(file(filename))</code>, but
because <a href="../../terraform/language/functions/file.html"><code>file</code></a> accepts only UTF-8 text it cannot be used to
create hashes for binary files.</p>

<p>Collision attacks have been successfully performed against this hashing
function. Before using this function for anything security-sensitive, refer to
<a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6151">RFC 6151</a> for updated security
considerations applying to the MD5 algorithm.</p>

<p>Other pages in this section have described various configuration constructs
that can appear in the Terraform language. This page describes the lower-level
syntax of the language in more detail, revealing the building blocks that
those constructs are built from.</p>

<p>This page describes the <em>native syntax</em> of the Terraform language, which is
a rich language designed to be relatively easy for humans to read and write.
The constructs in the Terraform language can also be expressed in
<a href="../../terraform/language/syntax/json.html">JSON syntax</a>, which is harder for humans
to read and edit but easier to generate and parse programmatically.</p>

<p>This low-level syntax of the Terraform language is defined in terms of a
syntax called <em>HCL</em>, which is also used by configuration languages in
other applications, and in particular other HashiCorp products.
It is not necessary to know all of the details of HCL syntax in
order to use Terraform, and so this page summarizes the most important
details. If you are interested, you can find a full definition of HCL
syntax in
<a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/hcl/blob/main/hclsyntax/spec.md">the HCL native syntax specification</a>.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Arguments%20and%20Blocks"></a><h2 id="arguments-and-blocks">Arguments and Blocks</h2>

<p>The Terraform language syntax is built around two key syntax constructs:
arguments and blocks.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Arguments"></a><h3 id="arguments">Arguments</h3>

<p>An <em>argument</em> assigns a value to a particular name:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="na">image_id</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"abc123"</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The identifier before the equals sign is the <em>argument name</em>, and the expression
after the equals sign is the argument's value.</p>

<p>The context where the argument appears determines what value types are valid
(for example, each resource type has a schema that defines the types of its
arguments), but many arguments accept arbitrary
<a href="../../terraform/language/expressions.html">expressions</a>, which allow the value to
either be specified literally or generated from other values programmatically.</p>

<aside class="admonition note">
    <strong>note</strong>
    <em>note</em>
    <p>Terraform's configuration language is based on a more general language called HCL, and HCL's documentation usually uses the word "attribute" instead of "argument." These words are similar enough to be interchangeable in this context, and experienced Terraform users might use either term in casual conversation. But because Terraform also interacts with several <em>other</em> things called "attributes" (in particular, Terraform resources have attributes like <code>id</code> that can be referenced from expressions but can't be assigned values in configuration), we've chosen to use "argument" in the Terraform documentation when referring to this syntax construct.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Blocks"></a><h3 id="blocks">Blocks</h3>

<p>A <em>block</em> is a container for other content:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kr">resource</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">"aws_instance"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">"example"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="na">ami</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"abc123"</span><span class="w"></span>

<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">network_interface</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="c1"></span>
<span class="c1">    # ...</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>A block has a <em>type</em> (<code>resource</code> in this example). Each block type defines
how many <em>labels</em> must follow the type keyword. The <code>resource</code> block type
expects two labels, which are <code>aws_instance</code> and <code>example</code> in the example above.
The <code>aws_instance</code> label is specific to the AWS provider. It specifies the <code>resource</code> type that Terraform provisions when you apply the configuration. The second label is an arbitrary name that you can add to the particular instance of the resource. You can create multiple instances of the same block type and differentiate them by giving each instance a unique name. In this example, the Terraform configuration author assigned the <code>example</code> label to this instance of the <code>aws_instance</code> resource. 
A particular block type may have any number of required labels, or it may
require none as with the nested <code>network_interface</code> block type.</p>

<p>After the block type keyword and any labels, the block <em>body</em> is delimited
by the <code>{</code> and <code>}</code> characters. Within the block body, further arguments
and blocks may be nested, creating a hierarchy of blocks and their associated
arguments.</p>

<p>The Terraform language uses a limited number of <em>top-level block types,</em> which
are blocks that can appear outside of any other block in a configuration file.
Most of Terraform's features (including resources, input variables, output
values, data sources, etc.) are implemented as top-level blocks.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Identifiers"></a><h2 id="identifiers">Identifiers</h2>

<p>Argument names, block type names, and the names of most Terraform-specific
constructs like resources, input variables, etc. are all <em>identifiers</em>.</p>

<p>Identifiers can contain letters, digits, underscores (<code>_</code>), and hyphens (<code>-</code>).
The first character of an identifier must not be a digit, to avoid ambiguity
with literal numbers.</p>

<p>For complete identifier rules, Terraform implements
<a href="http://unicode.org/reports/tr31/">the Unicode identifier syntax</a>, extended to
include the ASCII hyphen character <code>-</code>.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Comments"></a><h2 id="comments">Comments</h2>

<p>The Terraform language supports three different syntaxes for comments:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>#</code> begins a single-line comment, ending at the end of the line.</li>
<li><code>//</code> also begins a single-line comment, as an alternative to <code>#</code>.</li>
<li><code>/*</code> and <code>*/</code> are start and end delimiters for a comment that might span
over multiple lines.</li>
</ul>

<p>The <code>#</code> single-line comment style is the default comment style and should be
used in most cases. Automatic configuration formatting tools may automatically
transform <code>//</code> comments into <code>#</code> comments, since the double-slash style is
not idiomatic.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Character%20Encoding%20and%20Line%20Endings"></a><h2 id="character-encoding-and-line-endings">Character Encoding and Line Endings</h2>

<p>Terraform configuration files must always be UTF-8 encoded. While the
delimiters of the language are all ASCII characters, Terraform accepts
non-ASCII characters in identifiers, comments, and string values.</p>

<p>Terraform accepts configuration files with either Unix-style line endings
(LF only) or Windows-style line endings (CR then LF), but the idiomatic style
is to use the Unix convention, and so automatic configuration formatting tools
may automatically transform CRLF endings to LF.</p>

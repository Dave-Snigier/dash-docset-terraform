<p>The <a href="../../terraform/language/resources/behavior.html">Resource Behavior</a> page describes the general lifecycle for resources. Some details of
that behavior can be customized using the special nested <code>lifecycle</code> block
within a resource block body:</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Syntax%20and%20Arguments"></a><h2 id="syntax-and-arguments">Syntax and Arguments</h2>

<p><code>lifecycle</code> is a nested block that can appear within a resource block.
The <code>lifecycle</code> block and its contents are meta-arguments, available
for all <code>resource</code> blocks regardless of type.</p>

<p>The arguments available within a <code>lifecycle</code> block are <code>create_before_destroy</code>,
<code>prevent_destroy</code>, <code>ignore_changes</code>, and <code>replace_triggered_by</code>.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>create_before_destroy</code> (bool) - By default, when Terraform must change
a resource argument that cannot be updated in-place due to
remote API limitations, Terraform will instead destroy the existing object
and then create a new replacement object with the new configured arguments.</p>

<p>The <code>create_before_destroy</code> meta-argument changes this behavior so that
the new replacement object is created <em>first,</em> and the prior object
is destroyed after the replacement is created.</p>

<p>This is an opt-in behavior because many remote object types have unique
name requirements or other constraints that must be accommodated for
both a new and an old object to exist concurrently. Some resource types
offer special options to append a random suffix onto each object name to
avoid collisions, for example. Terraform CLI cannot automatically activate
such features, so you must understand the constraints for each resource
type before using <code>create_before_destroy</code> with it.</p>

<p>Note that Terraform propagates and applies the <code>create_before_destroy</code> meta-attribute
behaviour to all resource dependencies. For example, if <code>create_before_destroy</code> is enabled on resource A but not on resource B, but resource A is dependent on resource B, then Terraform enables <code>create_before_destroy</code> for resource B 
implicitly by default and stores it to the state file. You cannot override <code>create_before_destroy</code>
to <code>false</code> on resource B because that would imply dependency cycles in the graph.</p>

<p>Destroy provisioners of this resource do not run if <code>create_before_destroy</code>
is set to <code>true</code>. This <a href="https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/13549">GitHub issue</a> contains more details.</p></li>
<li><p><code>prevent_destroy</code> (bool) - This meta-argument, when set to <code>true</code>, will
cause Terraform to reject with an error any plan that would destroy the
infrastructure object associated with the resource, as long as the argument
remains present in the configuration.</p>

<p>This can be used as a measure of safety against the accidental replacement
of objects that may be costly to reproduce, such as database instances.
However, it will make certain configuration changes impossible to apply,
and will prevent the use of the <code>terraform destroy</code> command once such
objects are created, and so this option should be used sparingly.</p>

<p>Since this argument must be present in configuration for the protection to
apply, note that this setting does not prevent the remote object from
being destroyed if the <code>resource</code> block were removed from configuration
entirely: in that case, the <code>prevent_destroy</code> setting is removed along
with it, and so Terraform will allow the destroy operation to succeed.</p></li>
<li><p><code>ignore_changes</code> (list of attribute names) - By default, Terraform detects
any difference in the current settings of a real infrastructure object
and plans to update the remote object to match configuration.</p>

<p>The <code>ignore_changes</code> feature is intended to be used when a resource is
created with references to data that may change in the future, but should
not affect said resource after its creation. In some rare cases, settings
of a remote object are modified by processes outside of Terraform, which
Terraform would then attempt to "fix" on the next run. In order to make
Terraform share management responsibilities of a single object with a
separate process, the <code>ignore_changes</code> meta-argument specifies resource
attributes that Terraform should ignore when planning updates to the
associated remote object.</p>

<p>The arguments corresponding to the given attribute names are considered
when planning a <em>create</em> operation, but are ignored when planning an
<em>update</em>. The arguments are the relative address of the attributes in the
resource. Map and list elements can be referenced using index notation,
like <code>tags["Name"]</code> and <code>list[0]</code> respectively.</p>

</code></pre></div>

<p>Instead of a list, the special keyword <code>all</code> may be used to instruct
Terraform to ignore <em>all</em> attributes, which means that Terraform can
create and destroy the remote object but will never propose updates to it.</p>

<p>Only attributes defined by the resource type can be ignored.
<code>ignore_changes</code> cannot be applied to itself or to any other meta-arguments.</p></li>
<li><p><code>replace_triggered_by</code> (list of resource or attribute references) -
<em>Added in Terraform 1.2.</em> Replaces the resource when any of the referenced
items change. Supply a list of expressions referencing managed resources,
instances, or instance attributes. When used in a resource that uses <code>count</code>
or <code>for_each</code>, you can use <code>count.index</code> or <code>each.key</code> in the expression to
reference specific instances of other resources that are configured with the
same count or collection.</p>

<p>References trigger replacement in the following conditions:</p>

<ul>
<li>If the reference is to a resource with multiple instances, a plan to
update or replace any instance will trigger replacement.</li>
<li>If the reference is to a single resource instance, a plan to update or
replace that instance will trigger replacement.</li>
<li>If the reference is to a single attribute of a resource instance, any
change to the attribute value will trigger replacement.</li>
</ul>

<p>You can only reference managed resources in <code>replace_triggered_by</code>
expressions. This lets you modify these expressions without forcing
replacement.</p>

<p></p><p><code>replace_triggered_by</code> allows only resource addresses because the decision is based on the planned actions for all of the given resources. Plain values such as local values or input variables do not have planned actions of their own, but you can treat them with a resource-like lifecycle by using them with <a href="../../terraform/language/resources/terraform-data.html">the <code>terraform_data</code> resource type</a>.</p></li>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Custom%20Condition%20Checks"></a><h2 id="custom-condition-checks">Custom Condition Checks</h2>

<p>You can add <code>precondition</code> and <code>postcondition</code> blocks with a <code>lifecycle</code> block to specify assumptions and guarantees about how resources and data sources operate. The following examples creates a precondition that checks whether the AMI is properly configured.</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kr">resource</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">"aws_instance"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">"example"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>

<p>Custom conditions can help capture assumptions, helping future maintainers understand the configuration design and intent. They also return useful information about errors earlier and in context, helping consumers more easily diagnose issues in their configurations.</p>

<p>Refer to <a href="../../terraform/language/expressions/custom-conditions.html#preconditions-and-postconditions">Custom Conditions</a> for more details.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Literal%20Values%20Only"></a><h2 id="literal-values-only">Literal Values Only</h2>

<p>The <code>lifecycle</code> settings all affect how Terraform constructs and traverses
the dependency graph. As a result, only literal values can be used because
the processing happens too early for arbitrary expression evaluation.</p>

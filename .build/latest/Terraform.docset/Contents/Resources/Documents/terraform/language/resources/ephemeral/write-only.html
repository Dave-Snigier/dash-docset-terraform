<h1 id="use-write-only-arguments">Use write-only arguments</h1>

<p>Terraform resources can include ephemeral arguments, also known as attributes, for data that only needs to exist temporarily. An ephemeral argument on a resource is called a "write-only argument". Write-only arguments can help store generated sensitive data for the current Terraform operation, such as a short-lived password, token, or session identifier.</p>

<aside class="admonition note">
    <strong>note</strong>
    <em>Public Beta</em>
    <p>: Write-only arguments are in public beta and available in Terraform v1.11 and later.  Public beta features and APIs are subject to change.</p>

<p>Write-only arguments are only available during runtime, and Terraform omits them from state and plan files. On a new Terraform operation, a write-only argument always start as <code>null</code> before Terraform overwrites it with a new value from your configuration.</p>

<p>Write-only arguments are unique among other ephemeral constructs in Terraform because you can assign both ephemeral and non-ephemeral data as the value of a write-only argument.</p>

<!-- TODO: Update with a code sample when we have one

## Define a write-only value

## Set a write-only value

Example of setting an ephemeral value:

Example of setting a non-ephemeral value:

Add guidance on avoiding acciedentally leaking a non-ephemeral value in a write-only argument.

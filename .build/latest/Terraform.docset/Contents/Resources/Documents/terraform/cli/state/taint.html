<p>This topic provides an overview of how to recreate resources in Terraform. </p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Introduction"></a><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>By default, Terraform retrieves the latest state of each existing object and compares it with the current configuration when you run the <code>terraform apply</code> command. Terraform only takes action on objects that do not match the configuration. </p>

<p>When remote objects become damaged or degraded, such as when software
running inside a virtual machine crashes but the virtual machine is
still running, Terraform does not have no way to detect and respond
to the problem. This is because Terraform only directly manages the machine as a whole.</p>

<p>In some cases, Terraform can automatically infer that an object is in an
incomplete or degraded state. For example, when a complex object is partially created in the remote system or
when a provisioner step failed. When this occurs, Terraform automatically flags resources to recreate.</p>

<p>You can manually replace objects when Terraform is unable to infer that an object should be replaced.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Workflows"></a><h2 id="workflows">Workflows</h2>

<p>When you meed to replace an object, you can use the following methods.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Manually%20replace%20resources"></a><h3 id="manually-replace-resources">Manually replace resources</h3>

<p>Add the <a href="../../terraform/cli/commands/plan.html#replace-address"><code>-replace</code> flag</a>
to your <code>terraform plan</code> or <code>terraform apply</code> command:</p>

<pre><code>$ terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example"
# ...

  # aws_instance.example will be replaced, as requested
-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...
    }
</code></pre>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Replace%20resource%20in%20tainted%20state"></a><h3 id="replace-resource-in-tainted-state">Replace resource in <code>tainted</code> state</h3>

<p>Terraform applies the <code>tainted</code> status to objects in the state data when Terraform is able to infer that the object is in a degraded or damaged state. This status indicates that the object exists but may not be fully-functional. Terraform replaces objects in a <code>tainted</code> states during the next <code>plan</code> or <code>apply</code> operation.</p>

<pre><code>  # aws_instance.example is tainted, so must be replaced
-/+ resource "aws_instance" "example" {
      # ...
    }
</code></pre>

<p>If Terraform has marked an object as tainted but you consider it to be working
correctly and do not want to replace it, you can override Terraform's
determination using <a href="../../terraform/cli/commands/untaint.html">the <code>terraform untaint</code> command</a>,
after which Terraform will consider the object to be ready for use by any
downstream resource declarations.</p>

<p>You can force Terraform to mark a particular object as tainted using
<a href="../../terraform/cli/commands/taint.html">the <code>terraform taint</code> command</a>, but that approach is
deprecated in favor of the <code>-replace=...</code> option, which avoids the need to
create an interim state snapshot with a tainted object.</p>

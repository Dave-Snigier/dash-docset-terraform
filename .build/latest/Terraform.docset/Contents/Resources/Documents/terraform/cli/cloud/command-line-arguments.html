<p>When your configuration includes a <code>cloud</code> block, commands that
make local modifications to Terraform state and then push them back up to the remote workspace
accept the following option to modify that behavior:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>-ignore-remote-version</code> - Override checking that the local and remote
Terraform versions agree, making an operation proceed even when there is
a mismatch.</p>

<p>State-modification operations usually require using a local version of the
Terraform CLI that is compatible with the Terraform version selected
in the remote workspace settings. This prevents the
local operation from creating a new state snapshot that the workspace's
remote execution environment cannot decode.</p>

<p>We recommend against using this option unless absolutely necessary. Overriding this check can result
in an HCP Terraform workspace that is no longer able to complete remote operations with the currently
selected version of Terraform.</p></li>
</ul>

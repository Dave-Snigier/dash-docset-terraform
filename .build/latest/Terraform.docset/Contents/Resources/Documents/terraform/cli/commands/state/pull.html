                <h1 id="terraform-state-pull-command"><code>terraform state pull</code> command</h1>

<p>The <code>terraform state pull</code> downloads and outputs state information from a <a href="../../../terraform/language/state/remote.html">remote state</a> or local state.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Usage"></a><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Usage: <code>terraform state pull</code></p>

<p>This command downloads the state from its current location, upgrades the
local copy to the latest state file version that is compatible with
locally-installed Terraform, and outputs the raw format to stdout.</p>

<p>This is useful for reading values out of state (potentially pairing this
command with something like <a href="https://stedolan.github.io/jq/">jq</a>). It is
also useful if you need to make manual modifications to state.</p>

<p>You cannot use this command to inspect the Terraform version of
the remote state, as it will always be converted to the current Terraform
version before output.</p>

    <strong>note</strong>
    <em>note</em>
    <p>Terraform state files must be in UTF-8 format without a byte order mark (BOM). For PowerShell on Windows, use <code>Set-Content</code> to automatically encode files in UTF-8 format. For example, run <code>terraform state pull | sc terraform.tfstate</code>.</p>

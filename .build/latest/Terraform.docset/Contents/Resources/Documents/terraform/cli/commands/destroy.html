<p>The <code>terraform destroy</code> command deprovisions all objects managed by a Terraform configuration.</p>

<p>While you will typically not want to destroy long-lived objects in a production
environment, Terraform is sometimes used to manage ephemeral infrastructure
for development purposes, in which case you can use <code>terraform destroy</code> to
conveniently clean up all of those temporary objects once you are finished
with your work.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Usage"></a><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Usage: <code>terraform destroy [options]</code></p>

<p>This command is just a convenience alias for the following command:</p>

<pre><code>terraform apply -destroy
</code></pre>

<p>For that reason, this command accepts most of the options that
<a href="../../terraform/cli/commands/apply.html"><code>terraform apply</code></a> accepts, although it does
not accept a plan file argument and forces the selection of the "destroy"
planning mode.</p>

<p>You can also create a speculative destroy plan, to see what the effect of
destroying would be, by running the following command:</p>

<pre><code>terraform plan -destroy
</code></pre>

<p>This will run <a href="../../terraform/cli/commands/plan.html"><code>terraform plan</code></a> in <em>destroy</em> mode, showing
you the proposed destroy changes without executing them.</p>

<aside class="admonition note">
    <strong>note</strong>
    <em>note</em>
    <p>The <code>-destroy</code> option to <code>terraform apply</code> exists only in Terraform v0.15.2 and later. For earlier versions, you <em>must</em> use <code>terraform destroy</code> to get the effect of <code>terraform apply -destroy</code>.</p>

<p>You can use the <code>-target</code> option to destroy a particular resource and its dependencies:</p>

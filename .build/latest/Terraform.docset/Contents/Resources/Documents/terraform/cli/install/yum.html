<p>The primary distribution packages for Terraform are <code>.zip</code> archives containing
single executable files that you can extract anywhere on your system. However,
for easier integration with configuration management tools and other systematic
system configuration strategies, we also offer package repositories for
RedHat Enterprise Linux, Fedora, and Amazon Linux systems, which allow you to
install Terraform using the <code>yum install</code> or <code>dnf install</code> commands.</p>

<p>If you are instead using Debian or Ubuntu, you
might prefer to <a href="../../terraform/cli/install/apt.html">install Terraform from our APT repositories</a>.</p>

    <strong>note</strong>
    <em>note</em>
    <p>The Yum repositories discussed on this page are generic HashiCorp repositories that contain packages for a variety of different HashiCorp products, rather than just Terraform. Adding these repositories to your system will, by default, therefore make a number of other non-Terraform packages available for installation. That might then mask the packages that are available for some HashiCorp products in the main distribution repositories.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Repository%20Configuration"></a><h2 id="repository-configuration">Repository Configuration</h2>

<p>Before adding a repository you must determine which distribution you are using.
The following command lines refer to a placeholder variable <code>$release</code> which
you must replace with the appropriate value from the following list:</p>

<ul>
<li>Red Hat Enterprise Linux: <code>RHEL</code></li>
<li>Fedora: <code>fedora</code></li>
<li>Amazon Linux: <code>AmazonLinux</code></li>
</ul>

<p>If you are using a Yum-based distribution, add the repository using
<code>yum-config-manager</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo yum install -y yum-utils
sudo yum-config-manager --add-repo https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/<span class="nv">$release</span>/hashicorp.repo
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you are using a DNF-based distribution, add the repository using
<code>dnf config-manager</code> as follows:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo dnf install -y dnf-plugins-core
sudo dnf config-manager addrepo --from-repofile<span class="o">=</span>https://rpm.releases.hashicorp.com/<span class="nv">$release</span>/hashicorp.repo
</code></pre></div>

<p>In both cases, the Terraform package name is <code>terraform</code>. For example:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>yum install terraform
</code></pre></div>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Supported%20Architectures"></a><h2 id="supported-architectures">Supported Architectures</h2>

<p>The HashiCorp Yum/DNF server has packages only for the <code>x86_64</code>
architecture, which is also sometimes known as <code>amd64</code>.</p>

<p>There are no official packages available for other architectures, such as
<code>aarch64</code>. If you wish to use Terraform on a non-<code>x86_64</code> system,
<a href="../../terraform/downloads.html">download a normal release <code>.zip</code> file</a> instead.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Supported%20Distribution%20Releases"></a><h2 id="supported-distribution-releases">Supported Distribution Releases</h2>

<p>The HashiCorp Yum server contains release repositories for the
following distribution releases:</p>

<ul>
<li>AmazonLinux 2 and "latest"</li>
<li>Fedora 33</li>
<li>Fedora 34</li>
<li>Fedora 35</li>
<li>Fedora 36</li>
<li>Fedora 37</li>
<li>RHEL 7 (and CentOS 7)</li>
<li>RHEL 8 (and CentOS 8)</li>
<li>RHEL 9 (and CentOS 9)</li>
</ul>

<p>No repositories are available for other versions of these distributions or for
any other RPM-based Linux distributions. If you add the repository using
the above commands on other systems then you will see a 404 Not Found error.</p>

<p>Over time we will change the set of supported distributions, including both
adding support for new releases and ceasing to publish new Terraform versions
under older releases.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Choosing%20Terraform%20Versions"></a><h2 id="choosing-terraform-versions">Choosing Terraform Versions</h2>

<p>The HashiCorp Yum repositories contain multiple versions of Terraform, but
because the packages are all named <code>terraform</code> it is impossible to install
more than one version at a time, and <code>yum install</code> or <code>dnf install</code> will
default to selecting the latest version.</p>

<p>It's often necessary to match your Terraform version with what a particular
configuration is currently expecting. Use the following command to
retrieve the available versions in the repository index:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>yum --showduplicate list terraform
</code></pre></div>

<p>You can select a specific version to install by including it in the
<code>yum install</code> command line, as follows:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>yum install terraform-0.14.0-2.x86_64
</code></pre></div>

<p>If you are using a DNF-based distribution, similar use <code>dnf</code> instead of <code>yum</code>
when following the above steps.</p>

<p>If your workflow requires using multiple versions of Terraform at the same
time, for example when working through a gradual upgrade where not all
of your configurations are upgraded yet, we recommend that you use the
official release <code>.zip</code> files instead of the Yum packages, so you can install
multiple versions at once and then select which to use for each command you
run.</p>

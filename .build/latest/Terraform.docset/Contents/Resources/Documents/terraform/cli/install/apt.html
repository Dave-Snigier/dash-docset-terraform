<p>The primary distribution packages for Terraform are <code>.zip</code> archives containing
single executable files that you can extract anywhere on your system. However,
for easier integration with configuration management tools and other systematic
system configuration strategies, we also offer package repositories for
Debian and Ubuntu systems, which allow you to install Terraform using the
<code>apt install</code> command or any other APT frontend.</p>

<p>If you are instead using Red Hat Enterprise Linux, CentOS, or Fedora, you
might prefer to <a href="../../terraform/cli/install/yum.html">install Terraform from our Yum repositories</a>.</p>

    <em>note</em>
    <p>The APT repositories discussed on this page are generic HashiCorp repositories that contain packages for a variety of different HashiCorp products, rather than just Terraform. Adding these repositories to your system will, by default, therefore make several other non-Terraform packages available for installation. That might then mask some packages that are available for some HashiCorp products in the main Debian and Ubuntu package repositories.</p>

<p>Please follow the instructions in the <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/official-packaging-guide">Official Packaging Guide</a>.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Supported%20Architectures"></a><h2 id="supported-architectures">Supported Architectures</h2>

<p>The HashiCorp APT server has packages only for the <code>amd64</code>
architecture, which is also sometimes known as <code>x86_64</code>.</p>

<p>There are no official packages available for other architectures, such as
<code>arm64</code>. If you wish to use Terraform on a non-<code>amd64</code> system,
<a href="../../terraform/downloads.html">download a normal release <code>.zip</code> file</a> instead.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Supported%20Debian%20and%20Ubuntu%20Releases"></a><h2 id="supported-debian-and-ubuntu-releases">Supported Debian and Ubuntu Releases</h2>

<p>The HashiCorp APT server contains release repositories for a variety of
supported distributions, which are outlined in the <a href="https://www.hashicorp.com/official-packaging-guide">Official Packaging Guide</a>.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Installing%20a%20Specific%20Version%20of%20Terraform"></a><h2 id="installing-a-specific-version-of-terraform">Installing a Specific Version of Terraform</h2>

<p>The HashiCorp APT repositories contain multiple versions of Terraform, but
because the packages are all named <code>terraform</code> it is impossible to install
more than one version at a time, and <code>apt install</code> will default to selecting
the latest version.</p>

<p>It's often necessary to match your Terraform version with what a particular
configuration is currently expecting. You can use the following command to
see which versions are currently available in the repository index:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>apt policy terraform
</code></pre></div>

<p>If your workflow requires using multiple versions of Terraform at the same
time, for example when working through a gradual upgrade where not all
of your configurations are upgraded yet, we recommend that you use the
official release <code>.zip</code> files instead of the APT packages, so you can install
multiple versions at once and then select which to use for each command you
run.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Terraform%201.4.3%20and%20Later"></a><h3 id="terraform-143-and-later">Terraform 1.4.3 and Later</h3>

<p>As of Terraform 1.4.3, all published packages include a revision number by
default, starting with <code>-1</code>. This change means that in the case that we need
to publish an updated package for any reason, installers can automatically
retrieve the latest revision. You can learn more about this packaging change
in <a href="https://discuss.hashicorp.com/t/linux-packaging-debian-revision-change/42403">the announcement</a>.</p>

<p>You can install the latest revision for a particular version by including the
version in the <code>apt install</code> command, as follows:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt install <span class="nv">terraform</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span>.4.4-*
</code></pre></div>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Terraform%201.4.2%20and%20Earlier"></a><h3 id="terraform-142-and-earlier">Terraform 1.4.2 and Earlier</h3>

<p>Terraform 1.4.2 and earlier did not include a revision number for the first
revision, so you can use the following pattern to install a specific version:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>sudo apt install <span class="nv">terraform</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">1</span>.4.0
</code></pre></div>

<p>This topic provides reference information about the <code>terraform untaint</code> command.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Introduction"></a><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Terraform has a marker called <code>tainted</code> which it uses to track that an object
might be damaged and so a future Terraform plan ought to replace it.</p>

<p>Terraform automatically marks an object as "tainted" if an error occurs during
a multi-step "create" action, because Terraform can't be sure that the object
was left in a fully-functional state.</p>

<p>You can also manually mark an object as "tainted" using the deprecated command
<a href="../../terraform/cli/commands/taint.html"><code>terraform taint</code></a>, although we no longer recommend that
workflow.</p>

<p>If Terraform currently considers a particular object as tainted but you've
determined that it's actually functioning correctly and need <em>not</em> be replaced,
you can use <code>terraform untaint</code> to remove the taint marker from that object.</p>

<p>This command <em>will not</em> modify any real remote objects, but will modify the
state in order to remove the tainted status.</p>

<p>If you remove the taint marker from an object but then later discover that it
was degraded after all, you can create and apply a plan to replace it without
first re-tainting the object, by using a command like the following:</p>

<pre><code>terraform apply -replace="aws_instance.example[0]"
</code></pre>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Usage"></a><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Usage: <code>terraform untaint [options] address</code></p>

<p>The <code>address</code> argument is a <a href="../../terraform/cli/state/resource-addressing.html">resource address</a>
identifying a particular resource instance which is currently tainted.</p>

<p>This command also accepts the following options:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>-allow-missing</code> - If specified, the command will succeed (exit code 0)
even if the resource is missing. The command might still return an error
for other situations, such as if there is a problem reading or writing
the state.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-lock=false</code> - Don't hold a state lock during the operation. This is
dangerous if others might concurrently run commands against the same
workspace.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-lock-timeout=DURATION</code> - Unless locking is disabled with <code>-lock=false</code>,
instructs Terraform to retry acquiring a lock for a period of time before
returning an error. The duration syntax is a number followed by a time
unit letter, such as "3s" for three seconds.</p></li>
<li><p><code>-no-color</code> - Disables terminal formatting sequences in the output. Use this
if you are running Terraform in a context where its output will be
rendered by a system that cannot interpret terminal formatting.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>For configurations using the <a href="../../terraform/cli/cloud.html">HCP Terraform CLI integration</a> or the <a href="../../terraform/language/backend/remote.html"><code>remote</code> backend</a>
only, <code>terraform untaint</code>
also accepts the option
<a href="../../terraform/cli/cloud/command-line-arguments.html#ignore-remote-version"><code>-ignore-remote-version</code></a>.</p>

<p>For configurations using
<a href="../../terraform/language/backend/local.html">the <code>local</code> backend</a> only,
<code>terraform untaint</code> also accepts the legacy options
<a href="../../terraform/language/backend/local.html#command-line-arguments"><code>-state</code>, <code>-state-out</code>, and <code>-backup</code></a>.</p>

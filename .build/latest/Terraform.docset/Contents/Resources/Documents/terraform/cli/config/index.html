<p>You can configure the Terraform CLI in global settings, which are separate
from any Terraform configuration and which apply across all working directories.</p>

<p>The default behavior of the Terraform CLI is suitable in most cases. As a result,
most of the global settings relate to advanced or automated workflows, or
unusual environmental conditions, such as running Terraform on an air-gapped
instance.</p>

<ul>
<li>The <a href="../../terraform/cli/config/config-file.html">CLI config file</a> configures provider
installation and security features.</li>
<li>Several <a href="../../terraform/cli/config/environment-variables.html">environment variables</a> can
configure Terraform's inputs and outputs; this includes some alternate ways to
provide information that is usually passed on the command line or read from
the state of the shell.</li>
</ul>

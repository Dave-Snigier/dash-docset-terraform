                <h1 id="terraform-state-commands"><code>terraform state</code> commands</h1>

<p>The <code>terraform state</code> commands enable advanced state management.  </p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Introduction"></a><h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>You can use the <code>terraform state</code> commands to modify the <a href="../../../terraform/language/state.html">Terraform state</a> instead modifying the state directly.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Usage"></a><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Usage: <code>terraform state &lt;subcommand&gt; [options] [args]</code></p>

<p>Refer to the following subcommands for additional information:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/list.html"><code>terraform state list</code></a></li>
<li><a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/mv.html"><code>terraform state mv</code></a></li>
<li><a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/pull.html"><code>terraform state pull</code></a></li>
<li><a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/replace-provider.html"><code>terraform state replace-provider</code></a></li>
<li><a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/rm.html"><code>terraform state rm</code></a></li>
<li><a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/show.html"><code>terraform state show</code></a></li>
</ul>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Remote%20State"></a><h2 id="remote-state">Remote State</h2>

<p>The Terraform state subcommands all work with remote state just as if it
was local state. Reads and writes may take longer than normal as each read
and each write do a full network roundtrip. Otherwise, backups are still
written to disk and the CLI usage is the same as if it were local state.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Backups"></a><h2 id="backups">Backups</h2>

<p>All <code>terraform state</code> subcommands that modify the state write backup
files. The path of these backup file can be controlled with <code>-backup</code>.</p>

<p>Subcommands that are read-only (such as <a href="../../../terraform/cli/commands/state/list.html">list</a>)
do not write any backup files since they aren't modifying the state.</p>

<p>Note that backups for state modification <em>can not be disabled</em>. Due to
the sensitivity of the state file, Terraform forces every state modification
command to write a backup file. You'll have to remove these files manually
if you don't want to keep them around.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Command-Line%20Friendly"></a><h2 id="command-line-friendly">Command-Line Friendly</h2>

<p>The output and command-line structure of the state subcommands is
designed to be usable with Unix command-line tools such as grep, awk,
and similar PowerShell commands.</p>

<p>For advanced filtering and modification, we recommend piping Terraform
state subcommands together with other command line tools.</p>

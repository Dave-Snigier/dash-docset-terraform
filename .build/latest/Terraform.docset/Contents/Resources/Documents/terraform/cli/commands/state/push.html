                <h1 id="terraform-state-push-command"><code>terraform state push</code> command</h1>

<p>The <code>terraform state push</code> command uploads a local state file to <a href="../../../terraform/language/state/remote.html">remote state</a> or a local state. We only recommend using this command when you must manually modify the remote state.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Usage"></a><h2 id="usage">Usage</h2>

<p>Usage: <code>terraform state push [options] PATH</code></p>

<p>This command pushes the state specified by PATH to the currently
configured <a href="../../../terraform/language/backend.html">backend</a>.</p>

<p>If PATH is "-" then the state data to push is read from stdin. This data
is loaded completely into memory and verified prior to being written to
the destination state.</p>

<aside class="admonition note">
    <strong>note</strong>
    <em>note</em>
    <p>Terraform state files must be in UTF-8 format without a byte order mark (BOM). For PowerShell on Windows, use <code>Set-Content</code> to automatically encode files in UTF-8 format. For example, run <code>terraform state push | sc terraform.tfstate</code>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Terraform will perform a number of safety checks to prevent you from
making changes that appear to be unsafe:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Differing lineage</strong>: If the "lineage" value in the state differs,
Terraform will not allow you to push the state. A differing lineage
suggests that the states are completely different and you may lose
data.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Higher remote serial</strong>: If the "serial" value in the destination state
is higher than the state being pushed, Terraform will prevent the push.
A higher serial suggests that data is in the destination state that isn't
accounted for in the local state being pushed.</p></li>
</ul>

<p>Both of these safety checks can be disabled with the <code>-force</code> flag.
<strong>This is not recommended.</strong> If you disable the safety checks and are
pushing state, the destination state will be overwritten.</p>

<p>For configurations using the <a href="../../../terraform/cli/cloud.html">HCP Terraform CLI integration</a> or the <a href="../../../terraform/language/backend/remote.html"><code>remote</code> backend</a>
only, <code>terraform state push</code>
also accepts the option
<a href="../../../terraform/cli/cloud/command-line-arguments.html#ignore-remote-version"><code>-ignore-remote-version</code></a>.</p>

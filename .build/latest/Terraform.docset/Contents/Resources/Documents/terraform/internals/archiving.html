<h1 id="archiving-providers">Archiving Providers</h1>

<p>As contributors' circumstances change, development on a community-maintained Terraform provider can slow. When this happens, HashiCorp may use GitHub's "archiving" feature on the provider's repository, to clearly signal the provider's status to users.</p>

<p>What does archiving mean?</p>

<ol>
<li>The code repository and all commit, issue, and PR history will still be available.</li>
<li>Existing released binaries will remain available on the releases site.</li>
<li>Documentation for the provider will remain on the Terraform website.</li>
<li>Issues and pull requests are not being monitored, merged, or added.</li>
<li>No new releases will be published.</li>
<li>Nightly acceptance tests may not be run.</li>
</ol>

<p>HashiCorp may archive a provider when we or the community are not able to support it at a level consistent with our guidelines and community expectations.</p>

<p>Archiving is reversible. If anyone from the community is willing to maintain an archived provider, please reach out to the <a href="../terraform/docs/partnerships.html">Terraform Provider Development Program</a> at <em><a href="mailto:terraform-provider-dev@hashicorp.com">terraform-provider-dev@hashicorp.com</a></em>.</p>

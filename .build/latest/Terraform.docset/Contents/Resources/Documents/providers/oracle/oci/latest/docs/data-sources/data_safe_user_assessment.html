<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Argument%20Reference"></a><h2 id="argument-reference">Argument Reference</h2>

<p>The following arguments are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>user_assessment_id</code> - (Required) The OCID of the user assessment.</li>
</ul>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Attributes%20Reference"></a><h2 id="attributes-reference">Attributes Reference</h2>

<p>The following attributes are exported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>compartment_id</code> - The OCID of the compartment that contains the user assessment.</li>
<li><code>defined_tags</code> - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm">Resource Tags</a> Example: <code>{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}</code> </li>
<li><code>description</code> - The description of the user assessment.</li>
<li><code>display_name</code> - The display name of the user assessment.</li>
<li><code>freeform_tags</code> - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm">Resource Tags</a>  Example: <code>{"Department": "Finance"}</code> </li>
<li><code>id</code> - The OCID of the user assessment.</li>
<li><code>ignored_assessment_ids</code> - List containing maps as values. Example: <code>{"Operations": [ {"CostCenter": "42"} ] }</code> </li>
<li><code>ignored_targets</code> - List containing maps as values. Example: <code>{"Operations": [ {"CostCenter": "42"} ] }</code> </li>
<li><code>is_assessment_scheduled</code> - Indicates whether the assessment is scheduled to run.</li>
<li><code>is_baseline</code> - Indicates if the user assessment is set as a baseline. This is applicable only to saved user assessments.</li>
<li><code>is_deviated_from_baseline</code> - Indicates if the user assessment deviates from the baseline.</li>
<li><code>last_compared_baseline_id</code> - The OCID of the last user assessment baseline against which the latest assessment was compared.</li>
<li><code>lifecycle_details</code> - Details about the current state of the user assessment.</li>
<li><p><code>schedule</code> - Schedule of the assessment that runs periodically in this specified format: <version-string>;<version-specific-schedule></version-specific-schedule></version-string></p>

<p>Allowed version strings - "v1" v1's version specific schedule -<ss> <mm> <hh> <day-of-week> <day-of-month> Each of the above fields potentially introduce constraints. A workrequest is created only when clock time satisfies all the constraints. Constraints introduced: 1. seconds = <ss> (So, the allowed range for <ss> is [0, 59]) 2. minutes = <mm> (So, the allowed range for <mm> is [0, 59]) 3. hours = <hh> (So, the allowed range for <hh> is [0, 23]) <day-of-week> can be either '<em>' (without quotes or a number between 1(Monday) and 7(Sunday)) 4. No constraint introduced when it is '</em>'. When not, day of week must equal the given value <day-of-month> can be either '<em>' (without quotes or a number between 1 and 28) 5. No constraint introduced when it is '</em>'. When not, day of month must equal the given value </day-of-month></day-of-week></hh></hh></mm></mm></ss></ss></day-of-month></day-of-week></hh></mm></ss></p></li>
<li><code>schedule_assessment_id</code> - The OCID of the user assessment that is responsible for creating this scheduled save assessment.</li>
<li><code>state</code> - The current state of the user assessment.</li>
<li><code>statistics</code> - Map that contains maps of values. Example: <code>{"Operations": {"CostCenter": "42"}}</code> </li>
<li><code>system_tags</code> - System tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. For more information, see Resource Tags. Example: <code>{"orcl-cloud.free-tier-retained": "true"}</code> </li>
<li><code>target_ids</code> - Array of database target OCIDs.</li>
<li><code>time_created</code> - The date and time the user assessment was created, in the format defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC3339</a>.</li>
<li><code>time_last_assessed</code> - The date and time the user assessment was last executed, in the format defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC3339</a>.</li>
<li><code>time_updated</code> - The date and time the user assessment was last updated, in the format defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC3339</a>.</li>
<li><code>triggered_by</code> - Indicates whether the user assessment was created by the system or the user.</li>
<li><p><code>type</code> - The type of the user assessment. The possible types are:</p>

<p>LATEST: The latest assessment that was executed for a target. It can either be system generated as part of the scheduled assessments or user driven by refreshing the latest assessment. SAVED: A saved user assessment. All user assessments are saved in the user assessment history. SAVE_SCHEDULE: The schedule to periodically save the LATEST assessment of a target database. COMPARTMENT: An automatic managed assessment type that stores all details of the targets in one compartment. This will keep an up-to-date status of all potential risks identified in the compartment. It also keeps track of user count and target count for each profile available on the targets in a given compartment.  It is automatically updated once the latest assessment or refresh action is executed, as well as when a target is deleted or moved to a different compartment.</p></li>

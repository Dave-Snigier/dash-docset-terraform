<p>The following arguments are supported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>compartment_id</code> - (Required) The OCID of the compartment containing the resources you want to list.</li>
<li><code>name</code> - (Optional) Used to filter by the name of the object.</li>
<li><code>state</code> - (Optional) The lifecycle state of a resource. When specified, the operation only returns resources that match the given lifecycle state. When not specified, all lifecycle states are processed as a match.</li>
</ul>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Attributes%20Reference"></a><h2 id="attributes-reference">Attributes Reference</h2>

<p>The following attributes are exported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>workspaces</code> - The list of workspaces.</li>
</ul>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Workspace%20Reference"></a><h3 id="workspace-reference">Workspace Reference</h3>

<p>The following attributes are exported:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>compartment_id</code> - The OCID of the compartment that contains the workspace.</li>
<li><code>defined_tags</code> - Defined tags for this resource. Each key is predefined and scoped to a namespace. See <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm">Resource Tags</a>. Example: <code>{"Operations.CostCenter": "42"}</code> </li>
<li><code>description</code> - A user defined description for the workspace.</li>
<li><code>display_name</code> - A user-friendly display name for the workspace. Does not have to be unique, and can be modified. Avoid entering confidential information.</li>
<li><code>dns_server_ip</code> - The IP of the custom DNS.</li>
<li><code>dns_server_zone</code> - The DNS zone of the custom DNS to use to resolve names.</li>
<li><code>endpoint_id</code> - DCMS endpoint associated with the container/workspace. Returns null if there is none.</li>
<li><code>endpoint_name</code> - Name of the private endpoint associated with the container/workspace. Returns null if there is none.</li>
<li><code>freeform_tags</code> - Free-form tags for this resource. Each tag is a simple key-value pair with no predefined name, type, or namespace. See <a href="https://docs.cloud.oracle.com/iaas/Content/General/Concepts/resourcetags.htm">Resource Tags</a>. Example: <code>{"Department": "Finance"}</code> </li>
<li><code>id</code> - A system-generated and immutable identifier assigned to the workspace upon creation.</li>
<li><code>is_private_network_enabled</code> - Specifies whether the private network connection is enabled or disabled.</li>
<li><code>registry_id</code> - DCMS registry associated with the container/workspace. Returns null if there is none.</li>
<li><code>state</code> - Lifecycle states for workspaces in Data Integration Service CREATING - The resource is being created and may not be usable until the entire metadata is defined UPDATING - The resource is being updated and may not be usable until all changes are commited DELETING - The resource is being deleted and might require deep cleanup of children. ACTIVE   - The resource is valid and available for access INACTIVE - The resource might be incomplete in its definition or might have been made unavailable for administrative reasons DELETED  - The resource has been deleted and isn't available FAILED   - The resource is in a failed state due to validation or other errors STARTING - The resource is being started and may not be usable until becomes ACTIVE again STOPPING - The resource is in the process of Stopping and may not be usable until it Stops or fails STOPPED  - The resource is in Stopped state due to stop operation. </li>
<li><code>state_message</code> - A message describing the current state in more detail. For example, can be used to provide actionable information for a resource in failed state.</li>
<li><code>subnet_id</code> - The OCID of the subnet for customer connected databases.</li>
<li><code>time_created</code> - The date and time the workspace was created, in the timestamp format defined by RFC3339. </li>
<li><code>time_updated</code> - The date and time the workspace was updated, in the timestamp format defined by <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3339">RFC3339</a>.</li>
<li><code>vcn_id</code> - The OCID of the VCN the subnet is in.</li>

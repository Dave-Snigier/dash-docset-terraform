    <em>warning</em>
    <p>Terraform primarily deals with remote resources which are able to outlive a single Terraform run, and so local resources can sometimes violate its assumptions. The resources here are best used with care, since depending on local state can make it hard to apply the same Terraform configuration on many different local systems where the local resources may not be universally available. See specific notes in each resource for more information. <!-- cache-key: cdktf-0.20.1 input-422e6a0607950a31f3f628fa80a723f639c68e72168070b59d8f5b254d354249 --></p>

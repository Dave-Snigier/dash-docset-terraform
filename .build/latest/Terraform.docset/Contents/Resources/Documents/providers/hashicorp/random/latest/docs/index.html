<p>The "random" provider allows the use of randomness within Terraform
configurations. This is a <em>logical provider</em>, which means that it works
entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other
services.</p>

<p>Unconstrained randomness within a Terraform configuration would not be very
useful, since Terraform's goal is to converge on a fixed configuration by
applying a diff. Because of this, the "random" provider provides an idea of
<em>managed randomness</em>: it provides resources that generate random values during
their creation and then hold those values steady until the inputs are changed.</p>

<p>Even with these resources, it is advisable to keep the use of randomness within
Terraform configuration to a minimum, and retain it for special cases only;
Terraform works best when the configuration is well-defined, since its behavior
can then be more readily predicted.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated within the documentation of a specific resource, this
provider's results are <strong>not</strong> sufficiently random for cryptographic use.</p>

<p>For more information on the specific resources available, see the links in the
navigation bar. Read on for information on the general patterns that apply
to this provider's resources.</p>

<p>As noted above, the random resources generate randomness only when they are
created; the results produced are stored in the Terraform state and re-used
until the inputs change, prompting the resource to be recreated.</p>

<p>The resources all provide a map argument called <code>keepers</code> that can be populated
with arbitrary key/value pairs that should be selected such that they remain
the same until new random values are desired.</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code><span class="kr">resource</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">"random_id"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">"server"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">keepers</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="c1"></span>
<span class="c1">    # Generate a new id each time we switch to a new AMI id</span>

<span class="kr">resource</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nc">"aws_instance"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">"server"</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="nb">tags</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="p">{</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">    </span><span class="na">Name</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="s2">"web-server ${random_id.server.hex}"</span><span class="w"></span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="p">}</span><span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">  # Read the AMI id "through" the random_id resource to ensure that</span>
<span class="c1">  # both will change together.</span>
<span class="w">  </span><span class="na">ami</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="o">=</span><span class="w"> </span><span class="nv">random_id.server.keepers.ami_id</span><span class="c1"></span>

<span class="c1">  # ... (other aws_instance arguments) ...</span>
<span class="p">}</span><span class="w"></span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>Resource "keepers" are optional. The other arguments to each resource must
<em>also</em> remain constant in order to retain a random result.</p>

<p><code>keepers</code> are <em>not</em> treated as sensitive attributes; a value used for <code>keepers</code> will be displayed in Terraform UI output as plaintext.</p>

<p>To force a random result to be replaced, the <code>taint</code> command can be used to
produce a new result on the next run.</p>

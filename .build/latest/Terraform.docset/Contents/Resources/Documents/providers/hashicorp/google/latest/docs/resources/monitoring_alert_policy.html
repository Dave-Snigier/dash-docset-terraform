If set, no other conditions can be present.
Structure is <a href="#nested_conditions_conditions_condition_matched_log">documented below</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>condition_prometheus_query_language</code> -
(Optional)
A condition type that allows alert policies to be defined using
Prometheus Query Language (PromQL).
The PrometheusQueryLanguageCondition message contains information
from a Prometheus alerting rule and its associated rule group.
Structure is <a href="#nested_conditions_conditions_condition_prometheus_query_language">documented below</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>condition_sql</code> -
(Optional)
A condition that allows alerting policies to be defined using GoogleSQL.
SQL conditions examine a sliding window of logs using GoogleSQL.
Alert policies with SQL conditions may incur additional billing.
Structure is <a href="#nested_conditions_conditions_condition_sql">documented below</a>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nested_conditions_conditions_condition_absent"></a>The <code>condition_absent</code> block supports:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>aggregations</code> -
(Optional)
Specifies the alignment of data points in
individual time series as well as how to
combine the retrieved time series together
(such as when aggregating multiple streams
on each resource to a single stream for each
resource or when aggregating streams across
all members of a group of resources).
Multiple aggregations are applied in the
order specified.
Structure is <a href="#nested_conditions_conditions_condition_absent_aggregations">documented below</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trigger</code> -
(Optional)
The number/percent of time series for which
the comparison must hold in order for the
condition to trigger. If unspecified, then
the condition will trigger if the comparison
is true for any of the time series that have
been identified by filter and aggregations.
Structure is <a href="#nested_conditions_conditions_condition_absent_trigger">documented below</a>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>duration</code> -
(Required)
The amount of time that a time series must
fail to report new data to be considered
failing. Currently, only values that are a
multiple of a minute--e.g. 60s, 120s, or 300s
--are supported.</p></li>
<li><p><code>filter</code> -
(Optional)
A filter that identifies which time series
should be compared with the threshold.The
filter is similar to the one that is
specified in the
MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
call is useful to verify the time series
that will be retrieved / processed) and must
specify the metric type and optionally may
contain restrictions on resource type,
resource labels, and metric labels. This
field may not exceed 2048 Unicode characters
in length.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nested_conditions_conditions_condition_absent_aggregations"></a>The <code>aggregations</code> block supports:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>per_series_aligner</code> -
(Optional)
The approach to be used to align
individual time series. Not all
alignment functions may be applied
to all time series, depending on
the metric type and value type of
the original time series.
Alignment may change the metric
type or the value type of the time
series.Time series data must be
aligned in order to perform cross-
time series reduction. If
crossSeriesReducer is specified,
then perSeriesAligner must be
specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
and alignmentPeriod must be
specified; otherwise, an error is
returned.
Possible values are: <code>ALIGN_NONE</code>, <code>ALIGN_DELTA</code>, <code>ALIGN_RATE</code>, <code>ALIGN_INTERPOLATE</code>, <code>ALIGN_NEXT_OLDER</code>, <code>ALIGN_MIN</code>, <code>ALIGN_MAX</code>, <code>ALIGN_MEAN</code>, <code>ALIGN_COUNT</code>, <code>ALIGN_SUM</code>, <code>ALIGN_STDDEV</code>, <code>ALIGN_COUNT_TRUE</code>, <code>ALIGN_COUNT_FALSE</code>, <code>ALIGN_FRACTION_TRUE</code>, <code>ALIGN_PERCENTILE_99</code>, <code>ALIGN_PERCENTILE_95</code>, <code>ALIGN_PERCENTILE_50</code>, <code>ALIGN_PERCENTILE_05</code>, <code>ALIGN_PERCENT_CHANGE</code>.</p></li>
<li><p><code>group_by_fields</code> -
(Optional)
The set of fields to preserve when
crossSeriesReducer is specified.
The groupByFields determine how
the time series are partitioned
into subsets prior to applying the
aggregation function. Each subset
contains time series that have the
same value for each of the
grouping fields. Each individual
time series is a member of exactly
one subset. The crossSeriesReducer
is applied to each subset of time
series. It is not possible to
reduce across different resource
types, so this field implicitly
contains resource.type. Fields not
specified in groupByFields are
aggregated away. If groupByFields
is not specified and all the time
series have the same resource
type, then the time series are
aggregated into a single output
time series. If crossSeriesReducer
is not defined, this field is
ignored.</p></li>
<li><p><code>alignment_period</code> -
(Optional)
The alignment period for per-time
series alignment. If present,
alignmentPeriod must be at least
60 seconds. After per-time series
alignment, each time series will
contain data points only on the
period boundaries. If
perSeriesAligner is not specified
or equals ALIGN_NONE, then this
field is ignored. If
perSeriesAligner is specified and
does not equal ALIGN_NONE, then
this field must be defined;
otherwise an error is returned.</p></li>
<li><p><code>cross_series_reducer</code> -
(Optional)
The approach to be used to combine
time series. Not all reducer
functions may be applied to all
time series, depending on the
metric type and the value type of
the original time series.
Reduction may change the metric
type of value type of the time
series.Time series data must be
aligned in order to perform cross-
time series reduction. If
crossSeriesReducer is specified,
then perSeriesAligner must be
specified and not equal ALIGN_NONE
and alignmentPeriod must be
specified; otherwise, an error is
returned.
Possible values are: <code>REDUCE_NONE</code>, <code>REDUCE_MEAN</code>, <code>REDUCE_MIN</code>, <code>REDUCE_MAX</code>, <code>REDUCE_SUM</code>, <code>REDUCE_STDDEV</code>, <code>REDUCE_COUNT</code>, <code>REDUCE_COUNT_TRUE</code>, <code>REDUCE_COUNT_FALSE</code>, <code>REDUCE_FRACTION_TRUE</code>, <code>REDUCE_PERCENTILE_99</code>, <code>REDUCE_PERCENTILE_95</code>, <code>REDUCE_PERCENTILE_50</code>, <code>REDUCE_PERCENTILE_05</code>.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nested_conditions_conditions_condition_absent_trigger"></a>The <code>trigger</code> block supports:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>percent</code> -
(Optional)
The percentage of time series that
must fail the predicate for the
condition to be triggered.</p></li>
<li><p><code>count</code> -
(Optional)
The absolute number of time series
that must fail the predicate for the
condition to be triggered.</p></li>
</ul>

<p><a name="nested_conditions_conditions_condition_monitoring_query_language"></a>The <code>condition_monitoring_query_language</code> block supports:</p>

<ul>
<li><p><code>query</code> -
(Required)
Monitoring Query Language query that outputs a boolean stream.</p></li>
<li><p><code>duration</code> -
(Required)
The amount of time that a time series must
violate the threshold to be considered
failing. Currently, only values that are a
multiple of a minute--e.g., 0, 60, 120, or
300 seconds--are supported. If an invalid
value is given, an error will be returned.
When choosing a duration, it is useful to
keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
time series data (which may also be affected
by any alignments specified in the
aggregations field); a good duration is long
enough so that a single outlier does not
generate spurious alerts, but short enough
that unhealthy states are detected and
alerted on quickly.</p></li>
<li><p><code>trigger</code> -
(Optional)
The number/percent of time series for which
the comparison must hold in order for the
condition to trigger. If unspecified, then
the condition will trigger if the comparison
is true for any of the time series that have
been identified by filter and aggregations,
or by the ratio, if denominator_filter and

The percentage of time series that
must fail the predicate for the

<li><p><code>count</code> -
(Optional)
The absolute number of time series

<li><p><code>denominator_filter</code> -
(Optional)
A filter that identifies a time series that
should be used as the denominator of a ratio
that will be compared with the threshold. If
a denominator_filter is specified, the time
series specified by the filter field will be
used as the numerator.The filter is similar
to the one that is specified in the
MetricService.ListTimeSeries request (that
call is useful to verify the time series
that will be retrieved / processed) and must
specify the metric type and optionally may
contain restrictions on resource type,
resource labels, and metric labels. This

computing ratios, the aggregations and
denominator_aggregations fields must use the
same alignment period and produce time
series that have the same periodicity and
labels.This field is similar to the one in
the MetricService.ListTimeSeries request. It
is advisable to use the ListTimeSeries
method when debugging this field.

value is given, an error will be returned.
When choosing a duration, it is useful to
keep in mind the frequency of the underlying
time series data (which may also be affected
by any alignments specified in the
aggregations field); a good duration is long
enough so that a single outlier does not
generate spurious alerts, but short enough
that unhealthy states are detected and
alerted on quickly.</p></li>

(Optional)
When this field is present, the <code>MetricThreshold</code>
condition forecasts whether the time series is
predicted to violate the threshold within the

The number/percent of time series for which
the comparison must hold in order for the
condition to trigger. If unspecified, then
the condition will trigger if the comparison
is true for any of the time series that have
been identified by filter and aggregations,

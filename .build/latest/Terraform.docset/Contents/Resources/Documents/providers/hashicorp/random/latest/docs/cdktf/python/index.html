<h1 id="random-provider">Random Provider</h1>

<p>The "random" provider allows the use of randomness within Terraform
configurations. This is a <em>logical provider</em>, which means that it works
entirely within Terraform's logic, and doesn't interact with any other
services.</p>

<p>Unconstrained randomness within a Terraform configuration would not be very
useful, since Terraform's goal is to converge on a fixed configuration by
applying a diff. Because of this, the "random" provider provides an idea of
<em>managed randomness</em>: it provides resources that generate random values during
their creation and then hold those values steady until the inputs are changed.</p>

<p>Even with these resources, it is advisable to keep the use of randomness within
Terraform configuration to a minimum, and retain it for special cases only;
Terraform works best when the configuration is well-defined, since its behavior
can then be more readily predicted.</p>

<p>Unless otherwise stated within the documentation of a specific resource, this
provider's results are <strong>not</strong> sufficiently random for cryptographic use.</p>

<p>For more information on the specific resources available, see the links in the
navigation bar. Read on for information on the general patterns that apply
to this provider's resources.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Resource%20%22Keepers%22"></a><h2 id="resource-keepers">Resource "Keepers"</h2>

<p>As noted above, the random resources generate randomness only when they are
created; the results produced are stored in the Terraform state and re-used
until the inputs change, prompting the resource to be recreated.</p>

<p>The resources all provide a map argument called <code>keepers</code> that can be populated
with arbitrary key/value pairs that should be selected such that they remain
the same until new random values are desired.</p>

<p>Resource "keepers" are optional. The other arguments to each resource must
<em>also</em> remain constant in order to retain a random result.</p>

<p><code>keepers</code> are <em>not</em> treated as sensitive attributes; a value used for <code>keepers</code> will be displayed in Terraform UI output as plaintext.</p>

<p>To force a random result to be replaced, the <code>taint</code> command can be used to
produce a new result on the next run.

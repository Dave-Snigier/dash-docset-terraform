<p>Terraform supports authenticating to Azure Stack using <a href="azure_cli.html">the Azure CLI</a> or a Service Principal, either using a Client Secret (which is detailed in this guide) or <a href="service_principal_client_certificate.html">using a Client Certificate</a>.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/Creating%20a%20Service%20Principal"></a><h2 id="creating-a-service-principal">Creating a Service Principal</h2>

<p>A Service Principal is an application within Azure Active Directory whose authentication tokens can be used as the <code>client_id</code>, <code>client_secret</code>, and <code>tenant_id</code> fields needed by Terraform (<code>subscription_id</code> can be independently recovered from your Azure account details).</p>

<aside class="admonition warning">

    <em>warning</em>
    <p>This needs to be completed in the main Azure (Public) Portal - not the Azure Stack Portal.</p>
</aside>

<p>There are two tasks needed to create a Service Principal via <a href="https://portal.azure.com">the Azure Portal</a>:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create an Application in Azure Active Directory (which acts as a Service Principal)</li>
<li>Grant the Application access to manage resources in your Azure Subscription</li>
</ol>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/1.%20Creating%20an%20Application%20in%20Azure%20Active%20Directory"></a><h3 id="1-creating-an-application-in-azure-active-directory">1. Creating an Application in Azure Active Directory</h3>

<p>Firstly navigate to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/Overview">the <strong>Azure Active Directory</strong> overview</a> within the Azure Portal - <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview">then select the <strong>App Registration</strong> blade</a> and click <strong>Endpoints</strong> at the top of the <strong>App Registration</strong> blade. A list of URIs will be displayed and you need to locate the URI for <strong>OAUTH 2.0 AUTHORIZATION ENDPOINT</strong> which contains a GUID. This is your Tenant ID / the <code>tenant_id</code> field mentioned above.</p>

<p>Next, navigate back to <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_AAD_IAM/ActiveDirectoryMenuBlade/RegisteredApps/RegisteredApps/Overview">the <strong>App Registration</strong> blade</a> - from here we'll create the Application in Azure Active Directory. To do this click <strong>Add</strong> at the top to add a new Application within Azure Active Directory. On this page, set the following values then press <strong>Create</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - this is a friendly identifier and can be anything (e.g. "Terraform")</li>
<li><strong>Application Type</strong> - this should be set to "Web app / API"</li>
<li><strong>Sign-on URL</strong> - this can be anything, providing it's a valid URI (e.g. https://terra.form)</li>
</ul>

<p>Finally need to create a Password for the Azure Active Directory Application - to do this select <strong>Settings</strong> and then <strong>Keys</strong>. This screen displays the Passwords (Client Secrets) and Public Keys (Client Certificates) which are associated with this Azure Active Directory Application.</p>

<p>Enter a description for the Key and select when this password should expire - and then press <strong>Save</strong>. At this point the Password should be displayed - you'll need to copy it now, since it's only displayed once - which is the <code>client_secret</code>.</p>

<a class="dashAnchor" name="//apple_ref/cpp/Section/2.%20Granting%20the%20Application%20access%20to%20manage%20resources%20in%20your%20Azure%20and%20Azure%20Stack%20Subscriptions"></a><h3 id="2-granting-the-application-access-to-manage-resources-in-your-azure-and-azure-stack-subscriptions">2. Granting the Application access to manage resources in your Azure and Azure Stack Subscriptions</h3>

<p>Once the Application exists in Azure Active Directory - we can grant it permissions to modify resources in the Subscription. To do this, <a href="https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade">navigate to the <strong>Subscriptions</strong> blade within the Azure Portal</a>, then select the Subscription you wish to use, then click <strong>Access Control (IAM)</strong>, and finally <strong>Add</strong>.</p>

<aside class="admonition warning">
    <strong>warning</strong>
    <em>warning</em>
    <p>This will only give SPN access to your Azure Subscription - This is <strong>NOT</strong> required to interact with Azure Stack. To allow SPN access to Azure Stack you need to do it under Azure Stack Subscription <a href="https://portal.{region}.{domain}/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Billing/SubscriptionsBlade">navigate to the <strong>Subscriptions</strong> blade within the Azure Stack Portal</a>, then select the Subscription you wish to use, then click <strong>Access Control (IAM)</strong>, and finally <strong>Add</strong>.</p>
</aside>

<p>Firstly, specify a Role which grants the appropriate permissions needed for the Service Principal (for example, <code>Contributor</code> will grant Read/Write on all resources in the Subscription). There's more information about <a href="https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/documentation/articles/role-based-access-built-in-roles/">the built in roles available here</a>.</p>

<p>Secondly, search for and select the name of the Application created in Azure Active Directory to assign it this role - then press <strong>Save</strong>.</p>

<p>As we've obtained the credentials for this Service Principal - it's possible to configure it in a few different ways.</p>

<p>When storing the credentials as Environment Variables, for example:</p>

<div class="codehilite"><pre><span></span><code>$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ARM_METADATA_HOST</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"my.stack.instance.ca"</span>
$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ARM_CLIENT_ID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"</span>
$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ARM_CLIENT_SECRET</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"</span>
$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"</span>
$ <span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ARM_TENANT_ID</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">"00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"</span>
</code></pre></div>

<p>The following Provider block can be specified - where <code>0.5.0</code> is the version of the Azure Stack Provider that you'd like to use:</p>

<pre><code>provider "azurestack" {
  # Whilst version is optional, we /strongly recommend/ using it to pin the version of the Provider being used
  version = "=1.0.0"
}
</code></pre>

<p>More information on <a href="../index.html#argument-reference">the fields supported in the Provider block can be found here</a>.</p>

<hr/>

<p>It's also possible to configure these variables either in-line or from using variables in Terraform (as the <code>client_secret</code> is in this example), like so:</p>

<aside class="admonition warning">
    <strong>warning</strong>
    <em>warning</em>
    <p>We'd recommend not defining these variables in-line since they could easily be checked into Source Control.</p>
</aside>

<pre><code>variable "client_secret" {}

provider "azurestack" {
  # Whilst version is optional, we /strongly recommend/ using it to pin the version of the Provider being used
  version = "=1.0.0"

  metadata_host   = "https://management.region.myazurestack.com"
  subscription_id = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
  client_secret   = "${var.client_secret}"
  tenant_id       = "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000"
}
</code></pre>

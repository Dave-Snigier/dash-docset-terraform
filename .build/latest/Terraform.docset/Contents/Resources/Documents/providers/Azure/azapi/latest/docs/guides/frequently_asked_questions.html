<p>In some cases, when <code>body</code> refers to some sensitive properties, user may not get a clear plan as above. This happens when a property contains sensitive credential like a storage account's access key, the value won't be returned by design. </p>

<p>Please add <code>ignore_missing_property = true</code> to the resource block and apply it.</p>

<p>Similarly, values in incorrect casing might be returned and cause a diff. Please use <code>ignore_casing = true</code> to suppress it.</p>

<p>For example, <code>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets</code> has its own API and it can also be managed by <code>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks</code> API.</p>

<p>It's recommendded to manage <code>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks/subnets</code> in <code>Microsoft.Network/virtualNetworks</code> instead of using its own API.</p>

<p>The reason is, if subnets are defined separately, when update the vnet which has no definition of its subnets, 
its request body won't contain any subnets definitions, so existing subnets will be removed.</p>

<p><code>AzApi</code> provider will use embedded schema to verify the inputs, to skip the validation, please add <code>schema_validation_enabled = false</code> to the resource block.</p>

<p>More context: Properties like CMK(customer managed key) can't be set when create this resource. Because CMK depends on key vault key which depends on this resource's identity.</p>

<p>It can be solved by using <code>azapi_update_resource</code> to perform a multi-steps deployment, here's an <a href="https://github.com/Azure/terraform-provider-azapi/tree/main/examples/Microsoft.ServiceBus/ServiceBusNamespace-CMK/main.tf">example</a>.</p>
